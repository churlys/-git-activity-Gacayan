I learned that Git is a version control system that helps track changes in your code over time, you can revert mistakes and collaborate with other people. meanwhile Github is an online platform that hosts git repositories more like a google drive for Git Projects
these 2 platforms help you keep track of your progress with your workmates you collaborate with through branching and merging new codes along with backup and recovery.
This way you can never lose your code
